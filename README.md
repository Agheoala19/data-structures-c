#  Data Structures in C

This project is a collection of classic data structure implementations written in the C programming language. The goal is both educational and practical â€” to help learn how fundamental data structures work under the hood, and to provide a base for other C-based projects.

##  Implemented Structures

- Singly Linked List
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Hash Table
- *(Optional)* Graph (Adjacency List/Matrix, BFS, DFS)
